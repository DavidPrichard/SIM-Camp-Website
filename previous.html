        <h2>Summer 2015</h2>
        <p>In 2015, 23 rising 9<sup>th</sup> through 12<sup>th</sup> students attended the inaugural SIM Camp. SIM Camp introduced students to proofs and applications of math in algebraic topology and number theory. Campers also competed in daily math challenges for prizes.  On Friday, Olivia Lee from the  <a href="http://chemistry.illinois.edu/">Department of Chemistry</a> helped campers see how math relates to chemistry.</p>

<h4 class="centered">What is low dimensional topology?</h4>
	<p>Topology is the mathematical study of shapes and spaces and how to distinguish them. Someone who studies topology considers two spaces to be the same if you can deform one into the other by stretching and bending; for example, a coffee mug is topologically the same as a doughnut. The reason for this identification is that many geometric problems depend not on the exact shape of an object, but on the way it is put together. </p>
	<p>SIM Camp students  investigated some of the numerical invariants of spaces that help tell them apart. They proved the classification of compact surfaces, developed strategies for tic-tac-toe on a torus and Klein bottle, and tried to visualize higher dimensional cubes</p>
	<h4 class="centered">What is number theory?</h4>
	<p>Number theory is a broad subject that looks at why natural numbers behave the way they do, and has been called the "Queen of Mathematics," since it is such a foundational subject. Despite the simplicity of the natural numbers, many seemingly simple problems in number theory are unsolved. For example, the Goldbach Conjecture states that every even natural number larger than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers.  This conjecture was first stated in 1742, but it is still not known whether it is true.</p>
	<p> SIM Camp students learned the basics of proofs and modular, or "clock" arithmetic and enjoyed encrypting and decrypting messages using ciphers.</p>
