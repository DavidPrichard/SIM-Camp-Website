	<h3>Instructors</h3>

	<p><a href="http://math.illinois.edu/~emerrim2/"><strong class="name">Claire Merriman</strong></a> will run the cryptography course at SIM Camp Epsilon in 2016. She created and ran the number theory and cryptology class at the 2015 camp.  She is current a third year graduate student in mathematics, interested in differential geometry and number theory. During the academic year, Claire helps with outreach activities organized by the University of Illinois chapter of the <a href="http://math.uiuc.edu/awm/">Association of Women in Mathematics</a>, which encourage girls to continue studying math and science, as well as organizing the outreach activities in the <a href="http://math.illinois.edu/igl/">Illinois Geometry Lab</a>. Previously, she has taught Algebra 1 to gifted and talented rising 7th and 8th graders at the <a href="http://tip.duke.edu/">Duke TiP</a> summer program.</p>

 <p><a href="http://math.illinois.edu/~lanius2/"><strong class="name">Melinda Lanius</strong></a> will run the topological games course at SIM Camp Epsilon and the non-Euclidean geometry course at SIM Camp Delta. She was responsible for the algebraic topology curriculum at the 2015. She is a fourth year graduate student in mathematics where she employs techniques from geometric analysis to solve problems in geometry and topology. She was a co-organizer of the <a href="http://math.uiuc.edu/~phierony/gardner100.html">2014 Gathering for Gardner</a> and the <a href="http://math.illinois.edu/pi-day/">2015 Pi Day</a>.

<p><a href="http://math.uiuc.edu/~riveraq2/"><strong class="name">Vanessa Rivera Qui&ntildeones</a></strong> will run the mathematical biology course at SIM Camp Delta.  She is a third year student in the department of mathematics, interested in adaptive dynamics and differential equations</p>
